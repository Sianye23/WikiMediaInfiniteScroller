# WikiMediaInfiniteScroller

A program in flutter that generates a random word, tries to find an image for this word using the WikiMedia API (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php)
If sucessful the image displayed alongside it's word, if unsucessful its word is displayed with an error symbol
Generates in a lazy scrollable list

On the second page is me testing out some of the simple flutter functionality for user inputs
